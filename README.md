# Malware-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning


According to the recent studies, malicious software (malware) is increasing at an alarming rate, 
and some malware can hide in the system by using different obfuscation techniques. In order to 
protect computer systems and the Internet from the malware, the malware needs to be detected 
before it affects a large number of systems. Recently, there have been made several studies on 
malware detection approaches. However, the detection of malware still remains problematic.


Signature-based and heuristic-based detection approaches are fast and efficient to detect known 
malware, but especially signature-based detection approach has failed to detect unknown malware. 
On the other hand, behavior-based, model checking-based, and cloud-based approaches perform 
well for unknown and complicated malware; However, no approach can detect all malware in the 
wild. 


In this project we have worked on how machine learning can be combined with static and
behavioural analysis in order detect malware in a system . various machine learning algorithms are 
performed and compared with each other and we found that , random forest gave us best efficiency 
for detecting malware .

Later on our main focus will be on applying behavioural analysis and comparision between both 
static and behavioural approach will be shown so that an effiecient malware detection system can 
be constructed.
